Published in the Journal of Monetary Economics

The "code" folder contains the Fortran code that runs the quantitative experiments. Please see the text file "readme.txt" in this folder for detailed instructions on how to compile and run the code.  

The "data and figures" folder contains the SCF 2019 data and a Python script that produces all of the figures in the paper. Please ensure that you run this script AFTER running the Fotran code (otherwise you will not have the required output files).
